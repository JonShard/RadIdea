# RadIdea
A game Im working on during my summer break.

This game does not have a name yet, It started out as the idea colorcoded red-idea when i was sketching. 
I Twisted the name lightly to RadIdea, which is going to be its name for now.

RadIdea an arena fighter with up to 4 players where to goal is to kill all the others. 
A player can kill another by dropping mines or shooting projectiles at them. This requires "boost".
A player get boost from killing boids (peaceful npcs) flying around the map. The last person standing wins the round.
